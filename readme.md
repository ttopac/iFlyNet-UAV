# Estimating Flight State of Aerial Vehicle from Distributed Multimodal Data - Full-scale UAV

This project is under active development, and limited code is made public at this time.

## Summary
As an extension to [ttopac/iFlyNet-MW](https://github.com/ttopac/iFlyNet-MW), this project studies flight state awareness of a full-scale UAV from a multimodal distributed sensor network that is attached to one of its wings. 

## Code
This repository includes code for 
- (0_) Exploratory analysis of acquired data 
- (1_) Consolidation and synchronization of (i) SG/PZT, (ii) Wichita Wind Tunnel EDS, and (iii) Blackswift S0 UAV data 
- (2_) Training of a 1D ResNet model, which itself run on Google Colab. 

## Data
Accompanying data will be made public at a later time.
